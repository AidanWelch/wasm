WebAssembly is a technology at the intersection of web development and systems programming.

If you are a web developer that has not take systems programming or operating systems courses as part of a Computer Science program, Lin Clark's code cartoons, blogs, and videos can be very helpful in filling in some of the unfamiliar systems concepts that WebAssembly builds upon:
