## Notes

The intent of this exercise is to investigate some of the parallels between an instance of a WebAssembly module and an instance of a class in OOP languages.

In your solution, a WebAssembly instance should be considered an instance of a bank account, and mutable WebAssembly globals should be used to model private states as in a class.

No linear memory should be required!
