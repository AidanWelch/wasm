# Instructions append

WebAssembly does not have the concept of arrays. For the colors test, return a comma-delimited buffer of characters in the form:
`black,brown,red,orange,yellow,green,blue,violet,grey,white`

You will then have to internally build an array of structures using offsets and lengths to provide structure around this buffer.
